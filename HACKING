A brief overview for those that wish to work with the source.

The Makefiles and configure script are generated by the autogen.sh script,
usually only distributed with snapshot releases. Running autogen.sh requires
automake and autoconf. GNU gettext may also be needed by autogen.sh.

Git commits _require_ an explicit log message. Think it will be used in the
release Changelog.

Coders should respect general coding style (see CODING).

Coders, please resync po/POTFILES.in if you add or remove source files from src/
directory (using regen_potfiles.sh script in po/) and re-run intltool-update when
appropriate to keep translations in sync with the code.

Maintainers, don't forget to run make update-po before releases.

Translators, please have a look at po/README.
